## General Info
This is an AI-assisted stock trader’s financial instrument for detecting stock market manipulation patterns as per the technical analysis principles of one of the five "titans of technical analysis", Richard Wyckoff. 

The goal of this software is to assist with a trader’s decision in identifying profitable high-reward/low-risk entry positions of a stock by classifying price consolidation periods as either in "accumulation" or "distribution".
